# Final OOP Assignment - Paint Board
## ⚡Languages: Java⚡
# ⚡Using: Swing⚡
This is the final assignment from the OOP university class. In this assignment I created a board that you can paint on with
3 different shapes. You can choose from square, circle or hourglass. This app also includes sliders Length, Spacing and Radius.
Each of them has their own functionality. You can find more details about this assignment in this <a href="https://github.com/JakubecSamuel/OOPfinalTest/blob/main/OOPfinalTest/README.md">README</a> file.
## This project had a deadline so there may appear some bugs because of the time limit and my knowledge at that time
